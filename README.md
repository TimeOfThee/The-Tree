# The-Tree
This is a project that I completed in 1 month. It grows a random tree with elements that react to the 3 implemented weathers: wind, rain and snow. There is a day night cycle with a changing background and colors to show the cycle.

A - guide wind left.
D - guide wind right.
W - guide wind up.
S - guide wind down.
Space - next weather [wind,rain,snow].
Down - intensify weather.
Up - calm weather.
Enter - shift time [dawn,day,dusk,night].
P - reset tree (This happens automatically over time).

Debug can be turned on inside of the Plan class.
